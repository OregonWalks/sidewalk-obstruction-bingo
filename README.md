# Sidewalk Obstruction Bingo

A bingo game for [Oregon Walks](https://oregonwalks.org/) whose squares are made of things that obstruct sidewalks.

Visit https://sidewalk-obstruction-bingo.oregonwalks.org/ to play.

## Development

Commits that build successfully deploy to the [staging
server](https://sidewalk-obstruction-bingo-staging.yasskin.info). Once you've
verified that everything's working there, create a release to deploy to the
production site.

Use `npm run dev` to develop, and `npm run start` to try out the static pages
that will run in production.
